From y=0 in Underridge, changing your y level by the following amounts will take you to y=0 in the other dimensions:

511  (+511)    -> Nether
1086 (+575)    -> End
1533 (+447)    -> Overworld
1976 (+443)    -> Upper Sky

The height calculations allow you to 'skip' entire dimensions when teleporting relatively.

The total 'distance' between the Underridge and the height limit of the Upper Sky is 1976+256 = 2232 blocks.
This is the Fluid Dimensions world height span.

When teleporting certain amounts up/down you may incorrectly teleport.
This happens because it is not technically an intended feature and @#'!£%^("^&@*~$}€.
