From y=0 in Underridge, changing your y level by the following amounts will take you to y=0 in the other dimensions:

576         -> Nether
1152        -> Overworld
1724        -> Upper Sky

The height calculations allow you to 'skip' entire dimensions when teleporting large amounts relatively, but this is not supported and does not always work as intended.

Total height = 1980 blocks (Including y=0 in Underridge to y=255 in Upper Sky)
